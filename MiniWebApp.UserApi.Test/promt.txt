You are a senior ASP.NET Core integration testing expert.

Generate full integration test cases for the specified controller endpoint using the existing integration test infrastructure (WebApplicationFactory + PostgreSQL Testcontainers + JWT authentication).

The test suite MUST validate the following security and behavior scenarios:

1️⃣ Unauthorized Access
- When no JWT token is provided
- The endpoint must return 401 Unauthorized

2️⃣ Forbidden Access
- When a valid JWT is provided
- But the required permission policy is missing
- The endpoint must return 403 Forbidden

3️⃣ Invalid Input Validation
- Provide an invalid request payload (e.g., empty required fields)
- Validation must trigger FluentValidation
- The endpoint must return 400 BadRequest
- Ensure the API does not execute service logic

4️⃣ Valid Happy Path
- Provide valid JWT with required permissions
- Submit a valid request payload
- Validate correct success response:
  - POST → 201 Created
  - GET → 200 OK
- If applicable, verify returned data correctness

5️⃣ SQL Injection Attempt
- Submit malicious SQL payload (e.g., '; DROP TABLE X; --')
- Ensure:
  - No unhandled exception occurs
  - API does not crash
  - Database integrity remains intact
- Response should be either:
  - 400 (validation rejected)
  - OR valid 2xx if treated as normal string
- Explicitly validate that EF Core parameterization prevents DB corruption

6️⃣ XSS Script Injection Attempt
- Submit script-based payload (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>)
- Ensure:
  - API does not execute script
  - API remains stable
  - Validation or sanitization prevents unsafe behavior
- Response should be either:
  - 400 (blocked by validation)
  - OR safe 2xx with harmless stored value
- Confirm system stability under malicious input

Technical Requirements:
- Use integration tests (not unit tests)
- Use authenticated JWT via helper method
- Use real PostgreSQL Testcontainer
- No mocks
- Validate HTTP status codes explicitly
- Use clear test naming: Should_Return_401_When_Unauthorized
- Production-grade test structure
- No comments
- Clean assertions only

If generating tests for a new entity:
- Adjust permission names accordingly
- Adjust route accordingly
- Maintain the same security validation matrix
